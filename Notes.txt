Future Release

	collections.js
		1. Consolidate getUpcomingEvents and getPreviousEvents into one function
		2. Check why getNextEvents in needed, if the array is sorted properly can't I simply array.reverse() for future events?
		3. Most collections have this 'getNextID' method, can it be generalized?
		
	eventAuxView.js
		1. Rethink events attribute. Do I need hard coded id's for click events? The extra object is confusing.
		2. Instead of changing the edit button to a save button, simply hide the edit button and show the save button | for all
		
	eventDetailView.js
		1. Rething opening logic for load function, it's inherently confusing
		2. Instead of generating generate invoice button, simply show / hide it
		3. Do we want to rename invoiceSent / invoiceFiled into something more useful for scheudling staff?
		4. Instead of creating a save button, simply show / hide it with the edit button
		5. Should this.remove() instead of hiding the modal
		6. Instead of changing the view all events button to hide all events button, simply show / hide them
		7. Generally should be refactored. Overly complex and long. It shares a function with eventAuxView
		
	eventListView.js
		1. Refacotor openign logic for load function, is confusing af
		2. This model shares functions with both eventAuxView and eventDetailView, these should be generalized
	
	groupListView.js
		1. Rethink view_events function, what is the ordering of events? What is that first event it picks up?
		
	groupView.js
		1. Do I want a config file that determines things like the values in the group search field? What if they were paramaters for the user so they could pick what they wanted to search for / set defaults for their account?
